<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">E. Stanley Kroenke</h3>
<p><strong><em>Owner/Chairman, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, LLC</em></strong></p>
<div class="col-md-3">
<img src="https://i.cdn.turner.com/drp/nba/nuggets/sites/default/files/dn-skroenke-headshot.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="E. Stanley Kroenke"></div>
<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Mr. E. Stanley Kroenke became owner of the Denver Nuggets on July 6, 2000. Under his leadership, the Nuggets were one of only two NBA teams to make the playoffs in all 10 seasons from 2003 through 2013, including a thrilling run to the Western Conference Finals in 2009. Kroenke has overseen two Executive of the Year winners as well as one Coach of the Year award.</p>
<p>From 2006 to 2011, the Nuggets enjoyed their most successful five-year span in franchise history. Denver averaged 50.4 wins per season during this stretch, earned two Northwest Division titles and won 50+ games in four consecutive years for the first time in team history.</p>
<p>In addition to this unprecedented stretch, the Nuggets also enjoyed a single season of unmatched excellence in 2013. Denver won a franchise-record 57 games, including an all-time team best 15-game winning streak in March 2013. The Nuggets excelled in many areas that season, but most impressive was their 38-3 mark at Pepsi Center, the best home record in Denver franchise history.</p>
<p> In the summer of 2011, Kroenke elevated Josh Kroenke to team President and Governor. In his expanded role, Josh Kroenke hired Tim Connelly as General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in July 2013 and named Michael Malone as Head Coach in June 2015.</p>
<p>Under Kroenke’s ownership, the Colorado Avalanche have been one of the most accomplished hockey clubs in the NHL. In the team’s first season under his ownership (2000), the Avalanche hosted the NHL All-Star Game, won the Presidents’ Trophy, and defeated the New Jersey Devils to win the Stanley Cup, the second in franchise history (1996). The Avalanche have won four division championships under Kroenke’s watch, and during his first five years they sold out every home game and went on to post an NHL-record 487 consecutive game sellout streak. Additionally, the 2015-16 hockey season featured yet another landmark event with the Avalanche hosting the Coors Light NHL Stadium Series outdoor game on Feb. 27, 2016 at Coors Field.</p>
<p>Off the court, one of Kroenke’s priorities has been the Colorado community. More than $16 million in contributions have been made to Colorado charities through Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. The Nuggets continue to be a strong supporter of youth basketball in the State of Colorado through initiatives such as donating to youth basketball programs and providing numerous youth camps to help teach the game to local children.</p>
<p>Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment owns Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League’s Colorado Mammoth. The Rapids hosted the MLS All-Star Game in 2007 and 2015 and won the MLS Cup Championship in 2010. The Mammoth has been a playoff participant in 13 of its 14 seasons and won the NLL championship in 2006. The Mammoth also hosted the NLL All-Star Game in 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2011, Kroenke became the majority shareholder of Arsenal FC, the storied English Premier League football club. The St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) won the Super Bowl in 2000 while Mr. Kroenke was a co-owner; he became the team’s principal owner in August 2010.</p>
<p>Overall, the Nuggets, Avalanche, Rapids and Mammoth have made 37 playoff appearances, won three league championships and hosted five All-Star Games since 2000-01. Arsenal won the 2014 and 2015 FA Cup and has qualified for the Champions League in 19 consecutive seasons.</p>
<p>In addition to his success as an owner, Kroenke has been a pioneer in television programming. In September 2004, Kroenke launched Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment, a 24-hour regional television network that is the broadcast home for the Nuggets, Avalanche, Mammoth and Rapids.

<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Since joining the Denver Nuggets front office in 2007, team President and Governor Josh Kroenke has established himself as a highly regarded executive while overseeing one of the most successful stretches in franchise history.  In his role with the Nuggets, Kroenke is involved in every aspect of day-to-day operations and represents the team at NBA ownership meetings.</p>
<p>During Kroenke’s tenure, the Nuggets adapted to numerous changes to win at least 50 games in five straight non work-stoppage seasons from 2007 to 2013. They also advanced to the 2009 Western Conference finals and captured two Northwest Division titles during that span. He has overseen two NBA Executive of the Year awards, one NBA Coach of the Year award, six All-Star selections, three All-NBA selections and four players selected to All-Rookie teams. Additionally, former Nugget Allen Iverson, who played with the team from 2006 to 2008, was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame over this summer.</p>
<p>Kroenke, 37, was named Vice President of Team Development in 2007 and moved into his current role as President and Governor in 2010. In addition to his duties with the Nuggets, he serves as President and Governor of the Colorado Avalanche (National Hockey League) and Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (Major League Soccer).  On top of his roles with the Nuggets, Avalanche, and Rapids, Kroenke works closely with KSE executives on multiple business operation issues, ranging from finance to marketing.  In 2014, Kroenke was named to the Sports Business Journal’s prestigious “Forty Under 40” list. The annual list honors the most promising young executives in sports business under the age of 40.</p>
<p>During the 2010-11 season, Kroenke helped orchestrate one of the biggest trades in league history, completing a three-team, 13-player deal with the New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves on Feb. 22, 2011.  Kroenke and the Nuggets front office continued to improve the team’s roster through the draft and the trade market, and the Nuggets went on to win a team-record 57 games during the 2012-13 season. It marked the 10th straight year Denver reached the playoffs – the second-longest active streak in the NBA at the time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kroenke has spearheaded numerous business initiatives throughout Pepsi Center and the Denver Nuggets organization. In 2013 he oversaw the installation of a multimillion dollar 4,400 square foot HD center-hung scoreboard, one of the largest and most technologically advanced scoreboards in a professional sports arena. In just the past year he has unveiled new home, road and alternate jerseys for the Nuggets, overseen the complete redesign of the Nuggets’ locker room, training room and players’ lounge, and introduced the multimillion dollar Club Lexus,  offering exclusive amenities and services to court-side ticket holders.</p>
<p>Over the past several seasons, Kroenke has ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey.  The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core in 2013 by hiring first-year General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly and in 2015 Kroenke and Connelly hired Michael Malone to be the franchise’s new head coach.  In the summer of 2013, the Avalanche re-enlisted a legend from their Stanley Cup championship teams by hiring Hall of Fame center Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations. The Avalanche responded by winning the Central Division and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010. Their 112 points were the most by the club since their Stanley Cup Championship season in 2000-01. Kroenke, in conjunction with the National Hockey League, was instrumental in bringing the 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game to Denver. The event, which featured the Avalanche and the Red Wings playing at Coors Field on Feb. 27, 2016, was the first ever NHL outdoor game in the State of Colorado.</p>
<p>Athletic competition has always been a passion for Kroenke, who attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship. He was a contributor during Missouri’s trip to the Elite Eight as a sophomore in 2002, and he earned Academic All-Big XII First Team honors while serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons.  After graduating with a degree in financial management, Kroenke completed a six-month internship with the NBA’s League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked as an underwriter for Lehman Brothers in their Global Real Estate Group where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions.</p>
<p>Away from the Avalanche and Nuggets, Kroenke serves on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club in London and on the Board of Strategic Development for the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri.  Kroenke is an active supporter of Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. He is involved in several other charitable endeavors, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which was co-founded by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide by building schools that specialize in teaching music and arts.</p>

During his four-year stint as a scout for the Wizards, Connelly traveled across five continents to identify the top talent in the basketball world.</p>
<p>Connelly’s service to the game of basketball has spanned the globe in recent years. This past summer Connelly traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel and served as a coach as part of the NBA’s “Basketball Without Borders” program. He also worked in Moscow, Russia in 2012 for the program and his first experience with “BWB” came in the summer of 2006 in South Africa. That same summer he was involved with the Seed Academy in Dakar, Senegal. He has served on the board of GEN Basketball Academy, a Sarajevo-based academy funded by NATO, and has assisted with their youth camps. Additionally, in the summer of 2007, Connelly visited Dublin, Ireland to help raise youth awareness of cultural diversity and integration through the sport of basketball, and to work with the Irish federation on future basketball-related initiatives. Connelly has also visited England with his brother Pat as part of their personal efforts to aid the globalization of basketball.</p>
<p>Connelly is one of seven children, having four brothers and two sisters. Each of Connelly’s four brothers -- Joe, Pat, Dan and Kevin -- played basketball at Towson Catholic, the powerhouse Baltimore program, and their love of the game has not faded. His brother Pat was named the Phoenix Suns assistant general manager in 2013 while his brother Joe helped launch the Big3 League with Ice Cube this past year.</p>
<p>Connelly and his wife Negah recently hosted the 2nd annual Mile High Ping Pong Challenge which benefitted the “Bags of Fun” organization which provides toys and gifts to pediatric patients that are suffering from critical illnesses and disease.</p>
<p>Connelly and his wife Negah reside in Denver with their baby daughter and newborn son.</p>
