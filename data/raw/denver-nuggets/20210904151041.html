<p>Mr. E. Stanley Kroenke became owner of the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Pepsi Center on July 6, 2000.</p>
<p>The Nuggets are coming off a trip to the NBA Western Conference Finals in 2019-20, a run that included becoming the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3 games-to-1 series deficit twice in the same playoffs. The Avalanche have made the playoffs in each of the last three seasons—the third-longest streak in franchise history—and have advanced to the second round in back-to-back postseasons for the first time since 2006.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Kroenke’s leadership, the Nuggets were one of only two NBA teams to make the playoffs in all 10 seasons from 2003 through 2013, which included a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2009. From 2006 to 2011, Denver won 50+ games in four consecutive years for the first time in team history and followed that up by winning a franchise-record 57 games in 2012-13. Kroenke has overseen two NBA Executive of the Year winners as well as one Coach of the Year award.</p>
<p>Since Kroenke became owner, the Avalanche won a Stanley Cup (2001), captured four division championships (2000-03, 2013-14), won the Presidents’ Trophy (2001) and hosted the NHL All-Star Game (2001). During his first five years of ownership, the Avalanche sold out every home game and went on to post an NHL record 487 consecutive game sellout streak. The Avalanche have been chosen by the NHL to host two outdoor games in the past five years, as the organization hosted the 2016 Stadium Series at Coors Field and the 2020 Stadium Series at the U.S. Air Force Academy.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, Kroenke elevated Josh Kroenke to team President and Governor of the Nuggets. In his expanded role, Josh Kroenke hired Tim Connelly as General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in July 2013 and named Michael Malone as Head Coach in June 2015. Two years later, in the summer of 2013, Mr. Kroenke oversaw the elevation of Josh Kroenke to team President of the Avalanche. Josh Kroenke then named Joe Sakic the club’s Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations.</p>
<p>Off the ice and court, one of Kroenke’s priorities has been the Colorado community. More than $17 million in contributions have been made to Colorado charities through Kroenke Sports Charities and the Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets Community Funds. The Avalanche and Nuggets continue to be strong supporters of youth hockey and basketball in the state of Colorado through initiatives such as donating all game program sales to youth hockey and basketball teams, as well as sponsoring the Avalanche International Pee-Wee Qualifier Tournament and providing numerous youth basketball camps to help teach the game to local children. Additionally, the Kroenke family donated $1 million to the Red Cross organization following the hurricanes that devastated the coastal regions of the country in August 2017.</p>
<p>Denver-based Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment owns Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League’s Colorado Mammoth. The Rapids hosted the MLS All-Star Game in 2007 and 2015 and won the MLS Cup championship in 2010. The Mammoth has been a playoff participant in all but one of its seasons and won the NLL championship in 2006. The Mammoth also hosted the NLL All-Star Game in 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2011, Kroenke became the majority shareholder of Arsenal FC, the storied English Premier League football club. The St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) won the Super Bowl in 2000 while Mr. Kroenke was a co- owner; he became the team’s principal owner in August 2010. The Rams won the NFC championship during the 2018 season and played in Super Bowl LIII.</p>
<p>Overall, the Avalanche, Nuggets, Rapids and Mammoth have made 48 playoff appearances, won three league championships and hosted five All-Star Games since 2000-01. Arsenal won the 2014, 2015 and 2017 FA Cup and qualified for the Champions League in 19 consecutive seasons from 1998-99 to 2016-17, the second longest run ever.</p>
<p>In addition to his success as a team owner, Kroenke has been a pioneer in television programming. In September 2004, Kroenke launched Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment, a 24-hour regional television network that is the broadcast home for the Avalanche, Nuggets, Mammoth and Rapids. Altitude also airs professional, collegiate and high school sporting events throughout the Rocky Mountain region. KSE expanded its media position in 2013 with the acquisition of Outdoor Channel and in 2014 with the acquisition of Sportsman Channel. KSE also owns World Fishing Network.</p>
<p>KSE Radio owns three Denver FM radio stations, KIMN-FM (Mix 100.3), KXKL-FM (Kool 105) and KKSE-FM (Altitude Sports Radio 92.5), the radio broadcast home of the Avalanche, Nuggets, Mammoth and Rapids. KSE Radio also owns one Denver AM station, KKSE (Altitude Sports Radio 950 AM).</p>
<p>The Pepsi Center, a KSE-operated facility and the largest indoor arena, event center and concert venue in Colorado, is the home arena for the Avalanche, Nuggets and Mammoth. On April 7, 2007, KSE opened Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, one of the largest soccer specific complexes in the world. The state-of-the-art sports facility sits on more than 160 acres in Commerce City, Colorado, and holds 18,000 fans for field sports and up to 27,000 for concerts. KSE also owns the Paramount Theatre, a historic landmark in downtown Denver, and through Peak Entertainment, LLC, a joint venture between KSE and AEG Live Rocky Mountains, co-manages 1STBANK Center in Broomfield, a multi-use arena accommodating up to 6,500 people for a variety of events. Pepsi Center, Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, the Paramount Theatre and 1STBANK Center are home to more than 300 events annually, including world- renowned acts such as Garth Brooks, U2, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, Chris Stapleton, Aerosmith and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Kroenke’s enthusiasm and vision ensure that Denver will continue to be the top entertainment destination in the Rocky Mountain region for generations to come. Local media outlets have consistently named Kroenke one of the most significant people in the Denver arts and entertainment community, saying “no other person entertains more people more often.”</p>
<p>Kroenke is the chairman and owner of The Kroenke Group, a private real estate investment and development company with properties located throughout the United States and Canada. Over the past four decades, he has built a reputation as one of the nation’s leading real estate developers.</p>
<p>A member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Kroenke holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Missouri. In addition to their son Josh, who is President and Governor of the Avalanche and Nuggets and Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Stan and his wife, Ann, have a daughter, Whitney, an award-winning documentary film producer.</p>

<p><strong><em>President &amp; Governor, Denver Nuggets &amp; Colorado Avalanche</em></strong></p>

</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Josh Kroenke was promoted to Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment in the July of 2018. He begins his 11th season as team President/Governor for the Denver Nuggets and Governor of the Avalanche, as he was named to those positions in the summer of 2010. He assumed the additional title of Avalanche team President in 2013, making the upcoming 2020-21 campaign his eighth in that role.</p>
<p>Over the past several seasons, Kroenke has ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey. The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core in 2013 by hiring first-year General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly (now President of Basketball Operations). In 2015 Kroenke and Connelly hired Michael Malone to be the franchise’s new head coach who finished third in the NBA Coach of the Year voting in 2018-19. The summer of 2017 saw Kroenke and company land one of the largest free agents in the organization’s history by inking four-time All-Star Paul Millsap to a multiyear contract. He recently extended the contracts of franchise cornerstones Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic. Jokic was named an All-Star each of the last two seasons and First Team All-NBA in 2018-19 and Second Team in 2019-20.</p>
<p>During Kroenke’s tenure with the Nuggets they have registered six 50+ win seasons, two Western Conference Finals appearances and three Northwest Division titles. He has overseen two NBA Executive of the Year awards, one NBA Coach of the Year award, seven All-Star selections, five All-NBA selections and five players selected to All-Rookie teams. During the 2010-11 season, Kroenke helped orchestrate one of the biggest trades in league history, completing a three-team, 13-player deal with the New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves on Feb. 22, 2011, retooling the Nuggets roster that went on to win a team-record 57 games during the 2012-13 season.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, Kroenke named Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President/General Manager/Alternate Governor of the Avalanche. The Avalanche responded by winning the Central Division and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010. The past three seasons have seen the Avalanche make three consecutive postseason appearances for the first time in 14 years and advance to the second round in each of the last two years.</p>
<p>Kroenke, in conjunction with the National Hockey League, was instrumental in bringing the 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game to Denver. The event, which featured the Avalanche and the Red Wings playing at Coors Field on Feb. 27, 2016, was the first ever NHL outdoor game in the State of Colorado. The 2019-20 season saw the Avalanche host its second outdoor game in four years, this time at the U.S. Air Force Academy on Feb. 15, 2020 against the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
<p>In November 2017, the Avalanche was selected by the NHL to participate in the 2017 SAP NHL Global Series, which featured a pair of regular-season games against the Ottawa Senators in Stockholm, Sweden. These were the first regular-season games ever played by the Avs in Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to his responsibilities with the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke serves as Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (Major League Soccer) and is on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club (English Premier League) in London. In his role as Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, he works closely with KSE executives on multiple business operation.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kroenke was named to the SportsBusiness Daily’s prestigious “Forty Under 40” list. The annual list honors the most promising young executives in sports business under the age of 40.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kroenke has spearheaded numerous business initiatives throughout Ball Arena and the Nuggets and Avalanche organizations. In 2013 he oversaw the installation of a 4,400 square foot HD center-hung scoreboard, one of the largest and most technologically advanced scoreboards in a professional sports arena. In just the past two years he has unveiled new home, road and alternate jerseys for the Nuggets, overseen the complete redesign of the Nuggets’ locker room, training room and players’ lounge, and introduced Club Lexus, offering exclusive amenities and services to Nuggets and Avalanche ticket-holders.</p>
<p>Kroenke is also leading KSE into the fast-growing area of eSports. Instrumental in the decision to create KSE eSports, Kroenke acquired the inaugural franchise in Activision/ Blizzard’s Overwatch league, now known as the Los Angeles Gladiators. As co-founder of KSE eSports with his father Stan, Josh has helped guide all elements of the operation including branding and launch of the team in January 2018.</p>
<p>Athletic competition has always been a passion for Kroenke, who attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship. He was a contributor during Missouri’s trip to the Elite Eight as a sophomore in 2002, and he earned Academic All-Big XII First Team honors while serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons. After graduating with a degree in financial management, Kroenke completed a sixmonth internship with the NBA’s League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked on Wall Street where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions. </p>
<p>Away from the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke serves on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club in London and on the Board of Strategic Development for the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri. Kroenke is an active supporter of Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. He is involved in several other charitable endeavors, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which was co-founded by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide by building schools that specialize in teaching music and arts.

</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Tim Connelly begins his eighth season with the Denver Nuggets and his fourth as President of Basketball Operations. He previously served as General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations after being hired to that role in July 2013. Connelly works closely with President and Governor Josh Kroenke in all aspects of team and organizational matters as they aim to keep the Nuggets among the NBA elite.</p>
<p>During his tenure in Denver, Connelly and his staff have shown their knack for finding talent throughout the draft, highlighted by the selection of two-time All-Star Nikola Jokic with the 41st pick of the second round in 2014. He has also overseen the drafting of current starters Gary Harris and Jamal Murray, as well as promising prospects, Michael Porter Jr., Monte Morris and Bol Bol over the past seven seasons. Additionally, Connelly has helped draw the interest of free agents to Denver, including the signing of Paul Millsap in the summer of 2017.</p>
<p>Connelly has helped orchestrate the team’s turnaround in recent years as the Nuggets have ascended towards the top of the Western Conference. Denver has captured two straight Northwest Division titles (2018-19, 2019-20), marking the first time since 2008-09 and 2009-10 that the franchise repeated as division champions and just the fifth time in division history there was a repeat winner. Additionally, the Nuggets captured the third seed in the Western Conference playoffs in 2020, making the postseason in consecutive seasons for the first time since 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>Denver advanced to the Western Conference Finals last season, the first time for the franchise since 2009. It also marked the first time since 1985 and 1986 that Denver secured a playoff series win in consecutive years and they became the first team in NBA history to overcome two 3-1 series deficits in the same postseason.</p>
<p>Connelly, spent three seasons with the New Orleans Pelicans as their assistant general manager before coming to Denver. Prior to his time with New Orleans, Connelly spent 10 years with the Washington Wizards organization where he rose to director of player personnel. In Washington, his role included overseeing scouting, salary cap and database management, player evaluation responsibilities, as well as assisting the vice president of player personnel with all front office duties.</p>
<p>The Baltimore product began working for the Wizards as an intern in the basketball operations department in 1996, and after his graduation from DC’s Catholic University in 1999, Connelly was named to the Wizards staff as assistant video coordinator. In 2000, Connelly became a full-time scout for Washington, and later assumed the head scouting role. During his four-year stint as a scout for the Wizards, Connelly traveled across five continents to identify the top talent in the basketball world.</p>
<p>Connelly’s service to the game of basketball has spanned the globe in recent years. In 2018, Connelly traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel and served as a coach as part of the NBA’s “Basketball Without Borders” program. He also worked in Moscow, Russia in 2012 for the program and his first experience with “BWB” came in the summer of 2006 in South Africa. That same summer he was involved with the Seed Academy in Dakar, Senegal. He has served on the board of GEN Basketball Academy, a Sarajevo-based academy funded by NATO, and has assisted with their youth camps. Additionally, in the summer of 2007, Connelly visited Dublin, Ireland to help raise youth awareness of cultural diversity and integration through the sport of basketball, and to work with the Irish federation on future basketball-related initiatives. Connelly has also visited England with his brother Pat as part of their personal efforts to aid the globalization of basketball.</p>
<p>Connelly is one of seven children, having four brothers and two sisters. Each of Connelly’s four brothers -- Joe, Pat, Dan and Kevin -- played basketball at Towson Catholic, the powerhouse Baltimore program, and their love of the game has not faded.</p>
<p>Connelly and his wife Negah have orchestrated vast community events, including hosting an annual Mile-High Ping Pong Challenge which benefits local Denver community organizations.</p>
