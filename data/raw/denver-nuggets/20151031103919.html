<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">E. Stanley Kroenke</h3>
<p><strong><em>Owner &amp; Governor, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, LLC</em></strong></p>
<div class="col-md-3">
<img src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/drp/nba/nuggets/sites/default/files/dn-skroenke-headshot.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="E. Stanley Kroenke"></div>
<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Mr. E. Stanley Kroenke became owner of the Denver Nuggets on July 6, 2000. Under his leadership the Nuggets have been one of the most successful teams in the NBA. From 2003 through 2013, the Nuggets were one of only two NBA teams to make the playoffs in all 10 seasons, including a thrilling run to the Western Conference Finals in 2009. Kroenke has overseen two Executive of the Year winners as well as one Coach of the Year award.</p>
<p>From 2006 to 2011, the Nuggets enjoyed their most successful five-year span in franchise history. Denver averaged 50.4 wins per season during this stretch, earned two Northwest Division titles and won 50+ games in four consecutive years for the first time in team history.</p>
<p>In addition to this unprecedented stretch, the Nuggets also enjoyed a single season of unmatched excellence in 2013. Denver won a franchise-record 57 games, including an all-time team best 15-game winning streak in March 2013. The Nuggets excelled in many areas that season, but most impressive was their 38-3 mark at Pepsi Center, the best home record in Denver franchise history.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, Kroenke appointed Josh Kroenke team President and Governor. There were additional changes in the near future, as the Nuggets hired Tim Connelly as General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in July 2013 and named Michael Malone as Head Coach in June 2015.</p>
<p>The Colorado Avalanche, also under Kroenke’s ownership, remain one of the most accomplished hockey clubs in the NHL. In the team’s first season under his ownership (2000), the Avalanche hosted the NHL All-Star Game, won the Presidents’ Trophy, and defeated the New Jersey Devils to win the Stanley Cup, the second in franchise history (1996). The Avalanche have won four division championships under Kroenke’s watch, and during his first five years of ownership they sold out every home game and went on to post an NHL-record 487 consecutive game sellout streak. Additionally, the 2015-16 hockey season will feature yet another landmark event under Kroenke’s ownership with the Avalanche hosting the Coors Light NHL Stadium Series outdoor game on Feb. 27, 2016 at Coors Field.</p>
<p>Off the court, one of Kroenke’s primary focuses has been the Colorado community. More than $16 million in contributions have been made to Colorado charities through Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. The Nuggets continue to be a strong supporter of youth basketball in the State of Colorado through initiatives such as donating to youth basketball programs and providing numerous youth camps to help teach the game to local children.</p>
<p>Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Kroenke’s Denver-based company, owns Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League’s Colorado Mammoth. In 2007 the Rapids hosted the MLS All-Star Game and were chosen to again host the event this past season in 2015. The soccer club’s most successful campaign came in 2010, when they won the MLS Cup Championship and were honored at the White House for their achievement. The Mammoth has been a playoff participant in 12 of its 13 seasons and won the NLL championship in 2006. The Mammoth also hosted the NLL All-Star Game in 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2011, Kroenke became the majority shareholder of Arsenal FC, the storied English Premier League football club. The St. Louis Rams won the Super Bowl in 2000 while Mr. Kroenke was a co-owner; he became the team’s principal owner in August 2010.</p>
<p>Overall, the Nuggets, Avalanche, Rapids and Mammoth have made 36 playoff appearances, won three league championships and hosted five All-Star Games since 2000-01. Arsenal recently won the 2014 FA Cup and has qualified for the Champions League in 17 consecutive seasons.</p>
<p>In addition to his success as an owner, Kroenke has been an innovator in television programming. In September 2004, Kroenke launched Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment, a 24-hour regional television network that is the broadcast home for the Nuggets, Avalanche, Mammoth and Rapids. Altitude also airs professional, collegiate and high school sporting events throughout the Rocky Mountain region.  KSE acquired the Outdoor Channel in May 2013. The independent cable network is received by nearly 40 million U.S. households, making it the largest outdoor TV footprint in the country.</p>
<p>In 2014 KSE added to its outdoor media holdings with the acquisition of Sportsman Channel, which reaches more than 36 million U.S. households, along with a number of well-known outdoor enthusiast print and digital publications. Kroenke has also owned a 50-percent stake in the World Fishing Network since 2011, but in June 2015 purchased the remaining interest and now owns 100% of the network.</p>
<p>The Pepsi Center, a KSE-owned facility and the largest indoor arena, event center and concert venue in Colorado, is the home arena for the Nuggets, Avalanche and Mammoth, seating 19,155 for basketball and 18,007 fans for hockey.</p>
<p>On April 7, 2007, KSE opened Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, one of the largest soccer-specific complexes in the world. The state-of-the-art sports facility sits on more than 160 acres in Commerce City, CO, and seats 18,000 fans for field sports and up to 27,000 for concerts. KSE also owns the Paramount Theatre, a historic landmark in downtown Denver, and through Peak Entertainment, LLC, a joint venture between KSE and AEG Live Rocky Mountains, co-manages 1STBANK Center in Broomfield, CO, a multi-use arena accommodating up to 6,500 people for a variety of events. Pepsi Center, the Paramount Theatre and 1STBANK Center are home to more than 300 events annually, including world renowned acts such as Garth Brooks, U2, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Phish, Aerosmith and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Kroenke’s enthusiasm and vision ensure that Denver will continue to be the top entertainment destination in the Rocky Mountain region for generations to come. Local media outlets have consistently named Kroenke one of the most significant people in the Denver arts and entertainment community, saying “no other person entertains more people more often.”</p>
<p>Kroenke is chairman and owner of The Kroenke Group, a private real estate investment and development company with properties located throughout the United States and Canada. Over the past four decades, he has built a reputation as one of the nation’s leading real estate developers.</p>
<p>A member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Kroenke holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Missouri. In addition to their son Josh, who is also President and Governor of the Nuggets, Stan and his wife, Ann, have a daughter, Whitney, an award-winning documentary film producer.</p>

<p><strong><em>President and Governor</em></strong></p>

<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Since joining the Denver Nuggets front office in 2007, team President and Governor Josh Kroenke has established himself as a highly regarded executive while overseeing one of the most successful stretches in franchise history.  In his role with the Nuggets, Kroenke is involved in every aspect of day-to-day operations and represents the team at NBA ownership meetings.</p>
<p>During Kroenke’s tenure, the Nuggets adapted to numerous changes to win at least 50 games in five straight non work-stoppage seasons from 2007 to 2013. They also advanced to the 2009 Western Conference finals and captured two Northwest Division titles during that span.</p>
<p>Kroenke, 35, was named Vice President of Team Development in 2007 and moved into his current role as President and Governor in 2010. In addition to his duties with the Nuggets, he serves as President and Governor of the Colorado Avalanche (National Hockey League) and Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (Major League Soccer).  In addition to his roles with the Nuggets, Avalanche, and Rapids, Kroenke works closely with KSE executives on multiple business operation issues, ranging from finance to marketing.  In 2014, Kroenke was named to the Sports Business Journal’s prestigious “Forty Under 40” list. The annual list honors the most promising young executives in sports business under the age of 40.</p>
<p>During the 2010-11 season, Kroenke helped orchestrate one of the biggest trades in league history, completing a three-team, 13-player deal with the New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves on Feb. 22, 2011.  Kroenke and the Nuggets front office continued to improve its roster through the draft and the trade market, and the Nuggets went on to win a team-record 57 games during the 2012-13 season. It marked the 10th straight year Denver reached the playoffs – the second-longest active streak in the NBA at the time.</p>
<p>Over the past several seasons, Kroenke has ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey.  The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core in 2013 by hiring first-year General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly and in 2015 Kroenke and Connelly hired Michael Malone to be the franchise’s new head coach.  In the summer of 2013, the Avalanche re-enlisted legends from their Stanley Cup championship teams by hiring Hall of Fame center Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations and Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy as the team’s Head Coach/Vice President of Hockey Operations.  The Avalanche responded by winning the Central Division and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010. Their 112 points were the most by the club since their Stanley Cup Championship season in 2000-01. Kroenke, in conjunction with the National Hockey League, was instrumental in bringing the 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game to Denver. The event, which will feature the Avalanche and the Red Wings playing at Coors Field on Feb. 27, 2016, will be the first ever NHL outdoor game in the State of Colorado.</p>
<p>Athletic competition has always been a passion for Kroenke, who attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship. He was a contributor during Missouri’s trip to the Elite Eight as a sophomore in 2002, and he earned Academic All-Big XII First Team honors while serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons.  After graduating with a degree in financial management, Kroenke completed a six-month internship with the NBA’s League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked as an underwriter for Lehman Brothers in their Global Real Estate Group where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions.</p>
<p>Away from the Avalanche and Nuggets, Kroenke serves on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club in London and on the Board of Strategic Development for the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri.  Kroenke is an active supporter of KSE charities and is involved in several other charitable endeavors, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which was co-founded by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide by building schools that specialize in teaching music and arts.</p>

<p>Connelly, 38, spent the previous three seasons with New Orleans as their assistant general manager before coming to Denver. His duties included scouting, draft preparation, trade negations, player contracts and other aspects related to day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Prior to his time with New Orleans, Connelly spent 10 years with the Washington Wizards organization where he rose to director of player personnel. In Washington, his role included overseeing scouting, salary cap and database management, player evaluation responsibilities, as well as assisting the vice president of player personnel with all front office duties.</p>
<p>The Baltimore product began working for the Wizards as an intern in the basketball operations department in 1996, and after his graduation from DC’s Catholic University in 1999, Connelly was named to the Wizards staff as assistant video coordinator. In 2000, Connelly became a full-time scout for Washington, and later assumed the head scouting role. During his four-year stint as a scout for the Wizards, Connelly’s travels have taken him across five continents to identify the top talent in the basketball world.</p>
<p>Connelly’s service to the game of basketball has spanned the globe in recent years. He currently serves on the board of GEN Basketball Academy, a Sarajevo-based academy funded by NATO, and has assisted with their youth camps. Connelly also worked in Moscow, Russia in September 2012 as part of the NBA’s “Basketball Without Borders” program. Connelly’s first experience with the program was in the summer of 2006 in South Africa. That same summer he was involved with the Seed Academy in Dakar, Senegal. Additionally, in the summer of 2007, Connelly visited Dublin, Ireland to help raise youth awareness of cultural diversity and integration through the sport of basketball, and to work with the Irish federation on future basketball-related initiatives.  Connelly has also visited England with his brother Pat as part of their personal efforts to aid the globalization of basketball.</p>
<p>A graduate of Towson Catholic High School, Connelly has aspirations to further his involvement in grass-roots basketball programs in his hometown of Baltimore. He is one of seven children, having four brothers and two sisters. Each of Connelly’s four brothers -- Joe, Pat, Dan and Kevin -- played basketball at Towson Catholic, the powerhouse Baltimore program, and their love of the game has not faded. His brother Pat was named the Phoenix Suns assistant general manager in 2013.</p>
<p>Connelly and his wife Negah recently hosted the inaugural Mile High Ping Pong Challenge benefitting the Doreen Katz Memorial Cancer Foundation. The event raised money for children whose parents are battling cancer by providing grants for education and therapy.</p>
