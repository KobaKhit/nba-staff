<p><strong>E. Stanley Kroenke</strong><br><em>Owner &amp; Governor, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, LLC</em></p>
<div class="pull-left"><img style="margin:10px;" alt="E. Stanley Kroenke" class="img-responsive" src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/media/nuggets/kroenke_headshot_200x278.jpg"></div>
<p>Mr. E. Stanley Kroenke was officially introduced as the owner of the Denver Nuggets on July 6, 2000, and under his leadership, the Nuggets have enjoyed unprecedented success.</p>
<p>The Nuggets have been one of the most successful teams of the past decade and are one of only three NBA teams to make the playoffs in each of the past 10 seasons, including a remarkable run to the 2009 Western Conference Finals.</p>
<p>Since taking control of the Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Pepsi Center, Mr. Kroenke has been widely recognized as one of the top owners in professional sports, as well as a strong and committed leader throughout the community.</p>
<p>Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Mr. Kroenke’s Denver-based company, also owns Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League’s Colorado Mammoth. His teams have hosted the 2001 NHL All-Star Game, the 2004 and 2009 NLL All-Star Games, the 2005 NBA All Star Game and the 2007 MLS All-Star Game, bringing some of the world’s greatest athletes to Denver.</p>
<p>KSE’s dedication to success has been evidenced by the consistent playoff runs of its teams. The Avalanche has made the playoffs in 12 of its 16 seasons in Denver and defeated the New Jersey Devils in June 2001 to win the Stanley Cup, the second in franchise history. The Mammoth has been a playoff participant in seven of its nine seasons and won the NLL championship in 2006. The Rapids have also achieved postseason success appearing in the playoffs in six of nine seasons, including the MLS Cup in 2010.</p>
<p>In February 2007, Mr. Kroenke purchased a significant stake in Arsenal FC. He is the controlling shareholder of London’s storied football club. The initial investment came months after KSE and the Colorado Rapids formed a landmark marketing and strategic partnership with the famed Barclays Premier League club. The relationship has been further strengthened by KSE’s acquisition of 83 percent shareholding in Arsenal Broadband Limited. In September 2008, Mr. Kroenke was appointed to the Arsenal board as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>In August 2010, National Football League owners unanimously approved Mr. Kroenke’s bid to become principal owner of the St. Louis Rams. A native Missourian, Mr. Kroenke played a vital role in bringing the NFL back to St. Louis in 1995. Prior to becoming the majority owner of the Rams, he was the minority owner of the team. With his real estate development expertise, Mr. Kroenke was instrumental in the building of Rams Park, now known as the Russell Training Center.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Kroenke’s direction, KSE completed three of the company’s most ambitious projects to date. On April 7, 2007 KSE opened the largest soccer-specific complex in the world, Dick’s Sporting Goods Park. The state-of-the-art sports facility on more than 160 acres in Commerce City, Colo., seats 18,000 fans for field sports and up to 27,000 for concerts. The award-winning field at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park has been heralded as “one of the finest pitches in the world” by numerous international players and coaches who have played at the complex.</p>
<p>In November 2008, the stadium hosted Colorado’s first-ever World Cup qualifier between USA and Guatemala. Dick’s Sporting Goods Park also includes 24 surrounding playing fields for youth and adult recreational sports such as soccer, lacrosse and rugby. The complex anchors the 917-acre Prairie Gateway site that is a public-private partnership between KSE and Commerce City. The site is host to the Commerce City municipal hall, retail facilities, offices for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a visitors’ center for the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Wildlife Refuge. The project has created hundreds of jobs in the community and is expected to generate thousands more as the growth continues.</p>
<p>Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment, a 24-hour regional television network began operation in September 2004, becoming the new television home for the Nuggets and Avalanche. Altitude also features other professional, collegiate and high school sporting events, as well as outdoors and lifestyle programming, entertainment and community interest coverage throughout the Rocky Mountain West.</p>
<p>TicketHorse (now Altitude Tickets) became the official and exclusive ticket provider for both primary and secondary ticket sales for all KSE properties in July 2009.</p>
<p>One of KSE’s primary focuses has been the Colorado community and civic causes. $16 million in contributions have been made to Colorado charities through Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds.</p>
<p>KSE purchased the Paramount Theatre, a historic landmark in downtown Denver, in July 2002. The venerable venue remains a vibrant, multi-event facility where Denver residents and visitors enjoy a wide variety of entertainment ranging from classic concerts to family shows, dance productions, comedic performances and charitable events each year. Pepsi Center and the Paramount Theatre are home to more than 250 events annually including world renowned concerts such as Madonna, Celine Dion, U2 and Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>Peak Entertainment, LLC, a joint venture of Kroenke Sports Enterprises and AEG Live Rocky Mountains, opened 1STBANK Center together in March 2010. The multi-use arena accommodates up to 6,500 people for a range of events located in Broomfield, Colo. It was recently voted one of Colorado’s top new concert venues.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenke’s enthusiasm and vision ensure that Denver will continue to be the top entertainment destination in the Rocky Mountain region for generations to come. Local media outlets have consistently named Mr. Kroenke one of the most significant people in the Denver arts and entertainment community, saying “No other person entertains more people more often.”</p>
<p>In August of 2008, Pepsi Center played host to the Democratic National Convention. Tens of thousands of delegates, journalists, volunteers and patrons descended on Denver and the Pepsi Center for the Convention. The landmark event ranks as one of the most important in KSE and Colorado history.</p>
<p>Millions of people around the world watched the Convention, which city officials estimated boosted the local economy by nearly $270 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenke is chairman and owner of The Kroenke Group, a private real estate investment and development company with properties located throughout the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, he has built a reputation as one of the nation’s leading real estate developers. One of the largest ranch property owners in North America, Mr. Kroenke’s ownership stakes also includes the Screaming Eagle and Jonata vineyards.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenke’s current and former board and trustee memberships include Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Central Bank Holding Company, Boone County National Bank, Community Investments Partnership of St. Louis, the College of the Ozarks, and the Missouri Basketball Hall of Fame. He is a member of St. Louis’ Civic Progress, which provides support and leadership for various community improvements that promote economic development, education and quality of life. In February 2009, Mr. Kroenke was enshrined into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenke holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Missouri. He and his wife, Ann, have a daughter, Whitney, an award winning documentary film producer; and a son, Josh, Governor and President of the Denver Nuggets and Governor of the Colorado Avalanche.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Kroenke</strong><br><em>Team President and Governor</em></p>
<div class="pull-left"><img style="margin:10px;" alt="Josh Kroenke" class="img-responsive" src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/nuggets/photos/Kroenke_Josh_65x90.jpg"></div>
<p>Josh Kroenke is entering his seventh season in the Nuggets’ front office and third season as the team’s President &amp; Governor. He also serves as President and Governor of the Colorado Avalanche and Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids.</p>
<p>Since joining the Nuggets as Vice President of Team Development in 2007, Kroenke has been involved in every aspect of day-to-day operations while overseeing one of the most successful six-year stretches in team history. Denver has won at least 50 games in five seasons, made a trip to the Western Conference Finals and captured two Northwest Division titles during that span.</p>
<p>Kroenke orchestrated one of the biggest trades in NBA history on Feb. 22, 2011. The three-team, 13-player deal protected Denver’s long-term future while keeping the Nuggets among the NBA elite. After the trade, the Nuggets went 18-7 while clinching a playoff berth.</p>
<p>This past season, Kroenke ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey. The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core by hiring first-year head coach Brian Shaw and new general manager Tim Connelly, while the Avalanche re-enlisted legends from their Stanley Cup championship past.</p>
<p>Kroenke’s first duty as team president of the Avalanche was to name Hall of Fame center Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations, giving Sakic the responsibility of overseeing all hockey-related decisions. He then introduced Hall of Fame goalie Patrick Roy as the team’s Head Coach/Vice President of Hockey Operations on May 28, 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to his roles with the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke works closely with KSE’s executive committee on multiple business operation issues, ranging from finance to marketing.</p>
<p>Kroenke attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship and was named Academic All-Big XII First Team and selected team captain as a junior and senior. After graduating with a degree in financial management, he completed a six-month internship with the NBA’s League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked as an underwriter for Lehman Brothers in their Global Real Estate Group where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions.</p>
<p>Away from the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke is involved in several charitable entities, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which is operated by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide through the building of schools that specialize in the teaching of music and arts.</p>

<p><strong>Tim Connelly</strong><br><em>General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations</em></p>
<div class="pull-left"><img style="margin:10px;" alt="Tim Connelly" class="img-responsive" src="http://www.nba.com/nuggets/sites/nuggets/files/media/tim_connelly_65.jpg"></div>
<p>Tim Connelly was named the Denver Nuggets’ general manager and executive vice president of basketball operations on June 17, 2013. In this role, Connelly will work closely with team president Josh Kroenke to execute a plan to protect the team’s long-term future while keeping the Nuggets among the NBA elite.</p>
<p>Connelly, 36, spent the previous three seasons with New Orleans as their assistant general manager. His duties included scouting, draft preparation, trade negations, player contracts and other aspects related to day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Prior to his time with New Orleans, Connelly spent 10 years with the Washington Wizards organization where he rose to director of player personnel. In Washington, his role included overseeing scouting, salary cap and database management, player evaluation responsibilities, as well as assisting the vice president of player personnel with all front office duties.</p>
<p>The Baltimore product began working for the Wizards as an intern in the basketball operations department in 1996, and after his graduation from DC’s Catholic University in 1999, Connelly was named to the Wizards staff as assistant video coordinator. In 2000, Connelly became a full-time scout for Washington, and later assumed the head scouting role. During his four-year stint as a scout for the Wizards, Connelly’s travels have taken him across five continents to identify the top talent in the basketball world.</p>
<p>Connelly’s service to the game of basketball has spanned the globe in recent years. He currently serves on the board of GEN Basketball Academy, a Sarajevo-based academy funded by NATO, and has assisted with their youth camps. Connelly also worked in Moscow, Russia in September 2012 as part of the NBA’s “Basketball Without Borders” program. Connelly’s first experience with the program was in the summer of 2006 in South Africa. That same summer he was involved with the Seed Academy in Dakar, Senegal. Additionally, in the summer of 2007, Connelly visited Dublin, Ireland to help raise youth awareness of cultural diversity and integration through the sport of basketball, and to work with the Irish federation on future basketball-related initiatives.  Connelly has also visited England with his brother Pat as part of their personal efforts to aid the globalization of basketball.</p>
<p>A graduate of Towson Catholic High School, Connelly has aspirations to further his involvement in grass-roots basketball programs in his hometown of Baltimore. He is one of seven children, having four brothers and two sisters. Each of Connelly’s four brothers -- Joe, Pat, Dan and Kevin -- played basketball at Towson Catholic, the powerhouse Baltimore program, and their love of the game has not faded. Pat was named the Phoenix Suns assistant general manager this summer; Joe is currently the player development coach with the Washington Wizards; and Daniel is a regional scout for the Utah Jazz.</p>
