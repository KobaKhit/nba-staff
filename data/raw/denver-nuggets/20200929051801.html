Under his leadership, the Nuggets were one of only two NBA teams to make the playoffs in all 10 seasons from 2003 through 2013, including a thrilling run to the Western Conference Finals in 2009. Kroenke has overseen two Executive of the Year winners as well as one Coach of the Year award.</p>
<p>From 2006 to 2011, the Nuggets enjoyed their most successful five-year span in franchise history. Denver averaged 50.4 wins per season during this stretch, earned two Northwest Division titles and won 50+ games in four consecutive years for the first time in team history.</p>
<p>In addition to this unprecedented stretch, the Nuggets also enjoyed a single season of unmatched excellence in 2013. Denver won a franchise-record 57 games, including an all-time team best 15-game winning streak in March 2013. The Nuggets excelled in many areas that season, but most impressive was their 38-3 mark at Pepsi Center, the best home record in Denver franchise history.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, Kroenke elevated Josh Kroenke to team President and Governor. In his expanded role, Josh Kroenke hired Tim Connelly as General Manager and Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations (now President of Basketball Operations) in July 2013 and named Michael Malone as Head Coach in June 2015.</p>
<p>Under Kroenke’s ownership, the Colorado Avalanche have been one of the most accomplished hockey clubs in the NHL. In the team’s first season under his ownership (2000), the Avalanche hosted the NHL All-Star Game, won the Presidents’ Trophy, and defeated the New Jersey Devils to win the Stanley Cup, the second in franchise history (1996). The Avalanche have won four division championships under Kroenke’s watch, and during his first five  years they sold out every home game and went on to post an NHL-record 487 consecutive game sellout streak. Additionally, the 2015-16 hockey season featured yet another landmark event with the Avalanche hosting the Coors Light NHL Stadium Series outdoor game on Feb. 27, 2016 at Coors Field.</p>
<p>Off the court, one of Kroenke’s priorities has been the Colorado community. More than $16 million in contributions have been made to Colorado charities through Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. The Nuggets continue to be a strong supporter of youth basketball in the State of Colorado through initiatives such as donating to youth basketball programs and providing numerous youth camps to help teach the game to local children. Additionally, after the hurricanes that devastated the coastal regions in August 2017, the Kroenke family donated $1 million to the Red Cross Organization.</p>
<p>Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment owns Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League’s Colorado Mammoth. The Rapids hosted the MLS All-Star Game in 2007 and 2015 and won the MLS Cup Championship in 2010. The Mammoth has been a playoff participant in 14 of its 15 seasons and won the NLL championship in 2006. The Mammoth also hosted the NLL All-Star Game in 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2011, Kroenke became the majority shareholder of Arsenal FC, the storied English Premier League football club. He recently purchased the remaining stake in the club to control sole ownership. He also became the principal owner of the St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) in August 2010. The Rams won the Super Bowl in 2000 while Mr. Kroenke was a co-owner.</p>
<p>Overall, the Nuggets, Avalanche, Rapids and Mammoth have made 39 playoff appearances, won three league championships and hosted five All-Star Games since 2000-01. Arsenal won the 2014, 2015 and 2017 FA Cup and has qualified for the Champions League in 19 consecutive seasons from 1998-99 to 2015-16, the second longest run ever.</p>
<p>In addition to his success as an owner, Kroenke has been a pioneer in television programming. In September 2004, Kroenke launched Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment, a 24-hour regional television network that is the broadcast home for the Nuggets, Avalanche, Mammoth and Rapids. Altitude also airs professional, collegiate and high school sporting events throughout the Rocky Mountain region. KSE acquired the Outdoor Channel in May 2013. In 2014 KSE added to its outdoor media holdings with the acquisition of Sportsman Channel, along with a number of well-known outdoor enthusiast print and digital publications. KSE also owns the World Fishing Network.</p>
<p>On Dec. 31, 2015, KSE announced the acquisition of three Denver FM radio stations, KIMN-FM (Mix 100.3), KXKL-FM (Kool 105), and KKSE-FM (Altitude Sports Radio 92.5), the radio broadcast home for the Nuggets, Avalanche, Mammoth and Rapids. KSE Radio also owns one Denver AM station, KKSE (Altitude Sports Radio 950 AM).</p>
<p>The Pepsi Center, a KSE-owned facility and the largest indoor arena, event center and concert venue in Colorado, is the home arena for the Nuggets, Avalanche and Mammoth, seating 19,520 fans for basketball and 17,809 for hockey.</p>
<p>On April 7, 2007, KSE opened Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, one of the largest soccer-specific complexes in the world. The state-of-the-art sports facility sits on more than 160 acres in Commerce City, CO, and holds 18,000 fans for field sports and up to 27,000 for concerts. KSE also owns the Paramount Theatre, a historic landmark in downtown Denver, and through Peak Entertainment, LLC, a joint venture between KSE and AEG Live Rocky Mountains, co-manages 1STBANK Center in Broomfield, CO, a multi-use arena accommodating up to 6,500 people for a variety of events. Pepsi Center, the Paramount Theatre and 1STBANK Center are home to more than 300 events annually, including world renowned acts such as Garth Brooks, U2, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Phish, Aerosmith and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Kroenke’s enthusiasm and vision ensure that Denver will continue to be the top entertainment destination in the Rocky Mountain region for generations to come. Local media outlets have consistently named Kroenke one of the most significant people in the Denver arts and entertainment community, saying “no other person entertains more people more often.”</p>
<p>Kroenke is chairman and owner of The Kroenke Group, a private real estate investment and development company with properties located throughout the United States and Canada. Over the past four decades, he has built a reputation as one of the nation’s leading real estate developers.</p>
<p>A member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Kroenke holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Missouri. In addition to their son Josh, who is also President and Governor of the Avalanche, Stan and his wife, Ann, have a daughter, Whitney, an award-winning documentary film producer.</p>

<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Since joining the Denver Nuggets front office in 2007, team President and Governor Josh Kroenke has established himself as a highly regarded executive while overseeing every aspect of the day-to-day operations and represents the team at NBA ownership meetings. He remains President and Governor for both the Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche and was also promoted to Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>During Kroenke’s tenure, the Nuggets adapted to numerous changes to win at least 50 games in five straight non workstoppage seasons from 2007 to 2013. They also advanced to the 2009 Western Conference finals and captured two Northwest Division titles during that span. He has overseen two NBA Executive of the Year awards, one NBA Coach of the Year award, six All-Star selections, three All-NBA selections and five players selected to All- Rookie teams. Additionally, former Nugget Allen Iverson, who played with the team from 2006 to 2008, was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>Kroenke was named Vice President of Team Development in 2007 and moved into his current role as President and Governor in 2010. In addition to his duties with the Nuggets, he serves as President and Governor of the Colorado Avalanche (National Hockey League) and Alternate Governor for the Colorado Rapids (Major League Soccer). In his role as Vice Chairman of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Kroenke works closely with KSE executives on multiple business operation issues, ranging from finance to marketing. In 2014, Kroenke was named to the Sports Business Journal’s prestigious “Forty Under 40” list. The annual list honors the most promising young executives in sports business under the age of 40.</p>
<p>During the 2010-11 season, Kroenke helped orchestrate one of the biggest trades in league history, completing a three-team, 13-player deal with the New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves on Feb. 22, 2011. Kroenke and the Nuggets front office continued to improve the team’s roster through the draft and the trade market, and the Nuggets went on to win a team-record 57 games during the 2012-13 season. It marked the 10th straight year Denver reached the playoffs – the second-longest active streak in the NBA at the time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kroenke has spearheaded numerous business initiatives throughout Pepsi Center and the Denver Nuggets organization. In 2013 he oversaw the installation of a multimillion dollar 4,400 square foot HD center-hung scoreboard, one of the largest and most technologically advanced scoreboards in a professional sports arena. In just the past two years he has unveiled new home, road and alternate jerseys for the Nuggets, overseen the complete redesign of the Nuggets’ locker room, training room and players’ lounge, and introduced the multimillion dollar Club Lexus, offering exclusive amenities and services to Nuggets and Avalanche ticket-holders.</p>
<p>Kroenke is also leading KSE into the fast-growing area of eSports. He was instrumental in the decision to create KSE eSports to acquire an inaugural franchise in Activision/Blizzard’s Overwatch league, now known as the Los Angeles Gladiators. As co-founder of KSE eSports with his father Stan, Josh has helped guide all elements of the operation including branding and launch of the team in January 2018.</p>
<p>Over the past several seasons, Kroenke has ushered in new eras for both Nuggets basketball and Avalanche hockey. The Nuggets added to their young, energetic core in 2013 by hiring first-year General Manager/Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly (now President of Basketball Operations) and in 2015 Kroenke and Connelly hired Michael Malone to be the franchise’s new head coach. The summer of 2017 saw Kroenke and company land one of the largest free agents in the organization’s history by inking four-time All-Star Paul Millsap to a multi-year contract.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, the Avalanche re-enlisted a legend from their Stanley Cup championship teams by hiring Hall of Fame center Joe Sakic as Executive Vice President/General Manager/ Alternate Governor. The Avalanche responded by winning the Central Division and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010. Their 112 points were the most by the club since their Stanley Cup Championship season in 2000-01. Kroenke, in conjunction<br>
with the National Hockey League, was instrumental in bringing the 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game to Denver. The event, which featured the Avalanche and the Red Wings playing at Coors Field on Feb. 27, 2016, was the first ever NHL outdoor game in the State of Colorado.</p>
<p>Athletic competition has always been a passion for Kroenke, who attended the University of Missouri on a full basketball scholarship. He was a contributor during Missouri’s trip to the Elite Eight as a sophomore in 2002, and he earned Academic All-Big XII First Team honors while serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons. After graduating with a degree in financial management, Kroenke completed a six-month internship with the NBA’s League Office working in its Player Development Department. Upon finishing his internship, Kroenke worked on Wall Street where he assisted with the debt underwriting and securitization of numerous commercial real estate transactions.</p>
<p>Away from the Nuggets and Avalanche, Kroenke serves on the Board of Directors for Arsenal Football Club in London and on the Board of Strategic Development for the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri. Kroenke is an active supporter of Kroenke Sports Charities and the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche Community Funds. He is involved in several other charitable endeavors, including the Todd Peglow Memorial Scholarship Fund at the University of Missouri. He is also a major supporter of the Playing For Change Foundation, which was co-founded by his sister, Whitney, and benefits children worldwide by building schools that specialize in teaching music and arts.</p>

<p>Connelly is one of seven children, having four brothers and two sisters. Each of Connelly’s four brothers -- Joe, Pat, Dan and Kevin -- played basketball at Towson Catholic, the powerhouse Baltimore program, and their love of the game has not faded.

<div class="col-md-9">
<p>Michael Malone enters his fourth season as head coach of the Denver Nuggets. He was named the 16th head coach in Denver’s NBA franchise history on June 15, 2015.</p>
<p>This past season saw Coach Malone lead the Nuggets to a 46-36 record, their best overall record since 2013, while narrowly missing the playoffs by one game. Since Malone has taken over prior to the 2015-16 season the Nuggets have improved on their win total by a total of 16 wins (+3 after first season, +7 after second and +6 after third), making Denver one of three teams to increase their win total in each of the last three seasons (Minnesota and Boston).</p>

<p>Before joining the Nuggets, Malone served as the head coach of the Sacramento Kings for two seasons. Before his time with the Kings, Malone was the lead assistant for the Golden State Warriors under Mark Jackson from 2011-13 where they clinched a postseason berth in 2013, their first since 2007.</p>
<p>Prior to Golden State, Malone worked as the lead assistant to Monty Williams in New Orleans and helped the Hornets achieve a 46-36 record and a trip to the 2011 NBA Playoffs. The Hornets were the most improved defensive team in the NBA in 2011, allowing a league-best 8.7 fewer points per game than in the previous campaign (94.0 ppg, after giving up 102.7 ppg in 2009-10).</p>
