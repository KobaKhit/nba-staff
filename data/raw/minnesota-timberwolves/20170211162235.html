<p class="Normal1">Ethan Casson is entering his first season as Chief Executive Officer for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx. He most recently served as Chief Operating Officer for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal1">As the CEO, Casson oversees the business operations for the Timberwolves and Lynx, working closely with his executive team on setting the organization’s strategy and vision. His initial focus will be on the development of personnel, strengthening the fan base, driving key revenue opportunities and expanding the organization’s involvement in the community.&nbsp;</p>

He spearheaded the organization’s effort in securing a 20-year, $220 million naming rights partnership with Levi Strauss &amp; Co., one of the largest naming rights deals in NFL history. Under Casson’s direction, the first two seasons at Levi’s Stadium saw record-breaking revenue growth in several areas of the 49ers business, inclusive of ticket and premium sales and corporate partnerships.

<p>Tom Thibodeau (pronounced Thib-uh-DOE) was named the President of Basketball Operations and Head Coach of the Timberwolves on April 20, 2016, becoming the 12th head coach in franchise history. This is Thibodeau’s second stint with the Timberwolves, originally beginning his NBA career in Minnesota as an assistant under Bill Musselman from 1989-91.</p>
<p>A veteran of 25 seasons along the NBA sidelines, Thibodeau’s teams have advanced to the postseason in 19 seasons, including three trips to the NBA Finals (1999, 2008, 2010). Before returning to Minnesota, Thibodeau served as the head coach of the Chicago Bulls from 2010-15. Under his tutelage, the Bulls won at least 45 games and reached the playoffs in all five seasons, including holding the best record in the NBA in each of his first two seasons (2010-12). Thibodeau is one of two coaches in NBA history (Kerr) to accomplish the feat. His .647 winning percentage as head coach ranks seventh in NBA history (min. 200 games).</p>
<p>In his first season in Chicago, Thibodeau directed the Bulls to 62 wins in the 2010-11 season, becoming one of four coaches (Paul Westphal, Bill Russell, Steve Kerr) in NBA history to win 60 or more games in his first year as head coach. The Bulls 62 wins marked a 21-win improvement from the team’s 41-41 record the season before, the third-best single-season turnaround in club history. Thibodeau was named the 2010-11 Coach of the Year following the season.</p>
<p>Known as an elite defensive mind, Thibodeau’s teams have ranked in the top two in the league in defensive field goal percentage in nine of his last 12 seasons. In his five seasons with Chicago, the Bulls’ defense ranked in the top three in both points allowed and defensive field goal percentage four times, including allowing a franchise-low 88.2 points per game in 2011-12 (the fewest points allowed in the NBA since 2004).</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, he was named to Mike Krzyzewski’s staff as an assistant coach for the USA Basketball Men’s National Team and in 2014 the team went on to win the gold medal at the FIBA Basketball World Cup. Thibodeau will accompany the team at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August 2016.</p>
<p>Before joining the Bulls, Thibodeau served as associate head coach of the Boston Celtics from 2007-10, a stretch that saw the Celtics reach the NBA Finals twice and win the 2008 NBA Championship. In 2007-08, his first year with the Celtics, Boston held its opponents to 90.3 ppg, an improvement of 8.9 ppg from the previous season, and limited its foes to an NBA-low .419 field goal percentage, down from .468 the year before. During Boston’s 2008 playoff run that culminated in the franchise’s NBA-record 17th world championship, the Celtics held the Los Angeles Lakers to 93.8 ppg and .441 field-goal percentage in the NBA Finals (L.A. averaged 102.4 ppg and shot .468 from the field in the 2008 Playoffs).</p>
<p>Thibodeau began his NBA career as an assistant coach under Bill Musselman with the Timberwolves from 1989-91, while also serving as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs (1992-94), Philadelphia 76ers (1994-96), New York Knicks (1996-2003) and Houston Rockets (2003-07). He also spent the 1991-92 season as an advance scout for the Seattle SuperSonics. Before joining the NBA’s coaching ranks, Thibodeau coached at Salem State University (1981-85) and Harvard University (1985-89).</p>
<p>During his 25-year career, Thibodeau has coached under Bill Musselman, Jerry Tarkanian, John Lucas, Jeff Van Gundy, Don Chaney and Doc Rivers, while coaching players including Kevin Garnett, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Tracy McGrady, Yao Ming, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, Luol Deng, Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah.</p>
<p>Thibodeau, 58, was born in New Britain, Conn., on Jan. 17, 1958. He holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Counseling from Salem State University (Salem, Mass.), where he was a four-year letter winner in basketball. Thibodeau was team captain his senior season, and a member of back-to-back MASCAC Conference Champion squads in 1980 and 1981 (the first two basketball teams in school history to qualify for the Division III NCAA Tournament). He was inducted into the New Britain Sports Hall of Fame in 1998.</p>
