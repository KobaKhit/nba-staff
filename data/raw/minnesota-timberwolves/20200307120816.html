              <h2>Glen Taylor<span>Owner</span></h2>
              <p>On March 23, 1995, Glen Taylor closed the deal that made him majority owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves. He added the title of NBA owner to a list that already included international businessman, state senator, entrepreneur, philanthropist and Executive of the Year.</p>
              <p>Glen Taylor is chairman of Mankato, Minn. based Taylor Corporation, a multinational conglomerate of marketing, communications and interactive solutions companies. As he earned his degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato, he worked part time at Carlson Wedding Service, a print shop specializing in formal invitations. After graduation he continued his career at the company, developing strategies to cut delivery time, improve service and expand offerings. Since purchasing the company in 1975, Mr. Taylor has grown the organization into one of the largest privately held companies in the United States, with more than 80 companies across the globe and over 13,000 employees. Under his vision and leadership, Taylor has emerged as one of the top three graphics communications companies in North America, providing services to more than half of the Fortune 500 companies and millions of small businesses and consumers around the world. In 2000, Mr. Taylor invested in a leading agribusiness and food company, Rembrandt Enterprises, now one of the largest egg producers in the U.S. He expanded his breadth of businesses in July of 2014 as Mr. Taylor purchased the Star Tribune newspaper, Minnesota’s largest news organization, so that once again it would be owned outright by a Minnesotan. In 2016, he started another agribusiness, Prime Pork, in Windom, Minn. Mr. Taylor is an investor in Northland Securities, a full service investment bank in Minneapolis. He is also an investor in Envoy Medical, an implantable hearing therapy company. As an avid sports fan, Mr. Taylor continues to spread his involvement locally and has ownership in Minnesota’s new Major League Soccer team, Minnesota United.</p>
              <p>Taylor attended Harvard Graduate School of Business and earned his Bachelor of Science degree at Minnesota State University, Mankato. He is one of only three people to receive a Minnesota State University honorary doctorate degree.</p>
              <p>Taylor’s business savvy has been recognized by Corporate Report magazine, which honored him as its Executive of the Year (1987), and the Sales and Marketing Executives of Minneapolis/St. Paul, who awarded him with their Sales Executive of the Year Award (1999). He was also inducted into the Minnesota Hall of Fame (2002) by Twin Cities Monthly Magazine.</p>
              <p>Taylor was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1980, where he served until 1990. He became assistant Senate minority leader in 1982. From 1984 to 1986, he served as Senate Minority Leader. While in the Senate, Taylor was instrumental in providing leadership in the areas of higher education, child care and economic development policies.</p>
              <p>In October of 2008, Taylor was named Chairman of the NBA’s Board of Governors. He served as Chairman until late 2017.</p>
              <p>Taylor and his family have provided financial assistance and participated in mission trips to Africa, Turkey, Egypt, China and Central America to support children.</p>
              <p>Taylor and his wife, Becky, live in Mankato. Their children and grandchildren enjoy attending many of the Timberwolves games.</p>

              <h2>Ethan Casson<span>Chief Executive Officer</span></h2>
              <p class="s7">Ethan Casson is entering his&nbsp;fourth season as Chief Executive Officer for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Minnesota Lynx, the Iowa Wolves, and T-Wolves Gaming, a member of the NBA’s 2K League. Adding to his extensive scope of responsibilities, Casson also serves on the NBA Board of Governors as the Timberwolves and Lynx Alternate Governor.</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">As CEO, Casson oversees the business operations, working closely with the executive team on setting the organization’s strategic vision. In the spring of 2019, Casson was charged with leading the executive search for the President of Basketball Operations resulting in the hiring of Gersson Rosas. Rosas was previously an executive of the Houston Rockets for sixteen years and is considered one of the most innovative minds in the game today. Rosas also became the first Latino President/General Manager in the history of the NBA. The hire aligns with the focus of diversity, equality, and inclusion Casson champions for the organization. Under his leadership, diversity of the organization’s senior management has increased by forty percent.</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Another critical&nbsp;focus for the organization under Casson is the importance of Social Responsibility. Serving&nbsp;on several nonprofit boards locally and nationally, Casson is committed to using sports as a platform for providing&nbsp;support to the community. Prior to the 2019-20 NBA season, Casson announced&nbsp;the organization's "Pack Gives Back" campaign, unifying all four franchises and the Timberwolves and Lynx FastBreak Foundation. As a result of the significant&nbsp;social impact&nbsp;and community&nbsp;support, the organization was recognized as a 2019 Keystone Honored Company by the Minneapolis Chamber.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">In his tenure with the team, Casson implemented additional initiatives as part of an aggressive rebuild of the organization. In the Fall of 2016, Casson led a brand overhaul that included the rollout of a new logo and court, the unveiling of team uniforms, and the launch of a new marketing campaign. In an effort to re-establish Target Center’s resurgence in downtown Minneapolis, Casson oversaw the completion of the building’s $150 million renovation, the first major facelift in the venue’s 27-year history. The success of the project resulted in a nomination for the Sports Business Journal’s 2018 Facility of the Year and was chosen as Minnesota’s Finance &amp; Commerce Top Project of 2017.In the interest of growing the franchise’s popularity, Casson worked with the NBA to secure the Timberwolves as a participant in the 2017 NBA Global Games in China, playing against the defending NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. Additionally, the franchise purchased the NBA’s G-League team from Des Moines, now the Iowa Wolves, expanding the organization’s footprint throughout the Upper Midwest. On a local level, Casson partnered with the WNBA in bringing the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game to the Twin Cities, where the Minnesota Lynx played host.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">Since Casson’s arrival, the Timberwolves experienced consistent growth in all key metrics including season tickets, attendance, television viewership, corporate partnerships, merchandise and social engagement. The Minnesota Lynx remain the model franchise in the WNBA, having been named WNBA Franchise of the Year for the 2017 and 2018 seasons including being crowned WNBA Champions in 2017. Further, Casson led the efforts in securing an NBA 2K team, joining 22 other NBA franchises with a 2K eSports team. In its inaugural season, T-Wolves Gaming won the 2019 NBA 2K Championship.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">Prior to his current role, Casson spent six seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, initially as the team’s Vice President of Corporate Sales. He was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer in 2014 and Chief Operating Officer in 2016. Casson led a team focused on generating corporate revenue associated with the 49ers’ new stadium project. He spearheaded the organization’s effort in securing a 20-year, $220 million naming rights partnership with Levi Strauss &amp; Co., one of the largest naming rights deals in NFL history. Additionally, the team sold more than a dozen founding partnership deals, resulting in over $600 million in committed corporate revenue&nbsp;prior to the opening of Levi’s Stadium.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7"><br>
                Under&nbsp;Casson’s&nbsp;direction, Levi’s Stadium accomplished record-breaking growth in several areas of the 49ers business, inclusive of ticket and premium sales and corporate partnerships. In addition, Casson helped procure some of the most prominent events in sports and entertainment, including Super Bowl 50, WrestleMania 31, the NHL Outdoor Stadium Series, Pac-12 Championship Football, various music headliners and was awarded the host site for the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. The success of Levi’s Stadium resulted in several industry awards including the Sports Business Journal’s 2015 Facility of the Year and Venue of the Year at the 2015 Stadium Business Awards in Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp;Leveraging technology with sustainability, Levi’s Stadium generated international acclaim for its green efforts, becoming the first NFL stadium to be twice LEED Gold certified and was named the 2016 Green Sports Alliance Environmental Innovators of the Year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">Prior to his tenure with the San Francisco 49ers, Casson worked at the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Partnerships and with ESPN in sponsorship development.</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">Casson garnered industry-wide recognition for his accomplishments throughout his career, including being named to Minnesota Magazine’s 2018 and 2019 Minnesota 500, profiling the most influential&nbsp; business leaders in the state, C-Level Magazine’s CEO of the Month in February 2017, and being featured in Profile Magazine’s 2017 Q1 Executive Leadership Edition and Twin Cities Business Journal’s list of “100 People to Know” in 2016.&nbsp;He was honored as a member of Sports Business Journal’s Forty Under 40 class of 2014 and Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Forty Under 40 class of 2008.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="s7">Casson earned a Bachelor of Science in Sports Management from Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. A standout Division III college basketball player, he was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Colby-Sawyer College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2015.

              <h2>Gersson Rosas<span>President of Basketball Operations</span></h2>
              <p>Gersson Rosas enters his first season as President of Basketball Operations after being hired by the Timberwolves on May 3,
                2019. Rosas is responsible for all decisions within the Timberwolves basketball department.</p>
              <p> Rosas immediately went to work to build a franchise that was innovative, player-centric, family-oriented and championshipdriven. His first foray in building a sustainable winning model was hiring a forward-thinking staff including the hires of Ryan Saunders as Head Coach, Sachin Gupta as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations and Joe Branch and Gianluca
                Pascucci as Assistant General Managers. Rosas oversaw the completion of Saunders’ staff, including the hiring David
                Vanterpool, Pablo Prigioni, Bryan Gates, Kevin Hanson and Kevin Burleson.</p>
              <p> Rosas negotiated numerous player transactions this past summer, upgrading the team’s overall talent and depth. In the 2019
                NBA Draft, he traded up to get the No. 6 pick and selected guard Jarrett Culver from Texas Tech, and drafted guard Jaylen
                Nowell from Washington in the second round. Rosas traded for guards Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham and forward
                Jake Layman. Through free agency, Rosas signed forward/center Jordan Bell, forward Noah Vonleh and center Naz Reid.
                To ladder up to Rosas’ vision of an innovative and player-centric staff, Rosas hired Robby Sikka this summer as Vice President
                of Basketball Performance and Technology as the team integrates medical, technology, analytics and player development with
                the goal of improving basketball performance and player wellness.</p>
              <p> A strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, Rosas was recently named to the NBA’s Global Inclusion Council. This
                committee is comprised of senior leaders from the league office and teams and provides strategic guidance, establishes
                benchmarks, reviews policies and serves as a catalyst for diversity and inclusion efforts leaguewide.</p>
              <p> Rosas spent 17 seasons with the Houston Rockets, including the last five seasons as executive vice president of basketball
                operations. In that position, Rosas assisted Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey in all basketball operations of the franchise
                and was responsible for team building and player personnel matters, including leading the organization’s efforts in evaluating
                draft prospects, free agents and potential trade targets. In addition, Rosas oversaw domestic and international scouting, while
                also assisting in the coordination of the team’s player development program.</p>
              <p> Rosas served as the general manager of the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2013, becoming the first Latino GM in the
                history of the NBA, before returning to Houston. Rosas takes great pride in his Latino heritage and has made it a personal
                mission to create more opportunities for Latinos to follow in his footsteps. This past September, Rosas received the La
                Familia Latino Heritage Award for his role in promoting, supporting and contributing to the Latino community in Minnesota
                and throughout the nation.</p>
              <p> During Rosas’s tenure in Houston the Rockets made the playoffs 12 times, advancing to the Western Conference Finals
                in 2015 and 2018. In 2017-18, the Rockets were owners of the NBA’s best record (65-17), top offense in the league and
                a dynamic style of defense. Rosas played significant roles in developing the team’s philosophy and roster, including the
                successful pursuit of Most Valuable Player James Harden and Chris Paul via trade acquisitions along with the free agent
                recruitment of P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon. In addition, he was a leading force in the past draft selections of Clint Capela and
                Montrezl Harrell; trade acquisitions of Kyle Lowry, Goran Dragic and Luis Scola, and past free agent acquisitions of Dwight
                Howard and Patrick Beverley. Rosas also played a key role in head coach and coaching staff hires in the NBA (Mike D’Antoni,
                Kevin McHale) and NBA G League (Chris Finch, Nick Nurse).</p>
              <p> From 2009-12, Rosas was vice president of player personnel and was the Rocket’s director of player personnel in 2008-09.
                He worked one season as the team’s director of scouting (2007-08) after spending three seasons as personnel scout/video
                coordinator. In addition to his duties with the Rockets, Rosas previously served as General Manager of the Rio Grande Valley
                Vipers, Houston’s NBA G-League affiliate. In his first four full seasons as the Rio Grande Valley’s GM, the Vipers won G
                League Championships in the 2009-10 and 2012-13 seasons, while reaching the G League Finals three times in four years.
                The team compiled a 126-74 (.630) record and had 10 players earn All-NBA G League honors.</p>
              <p> In August of 2015, Rosas was named head scout/international player personnel for USA Basketball’s Men’s National Team. In
                that position, he assisted Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his staff in their Olympic gold medal winning run, which included
                player personnel matters, analytics processes and advance scouting for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
                In addition, Rosas is a current member of the USA basketball player selection committee for national team competitions.
                Rosas has been an active participant in the NBA’s Basketball Without Borders program since 2006 and currently serves as the
                Americans camp director. He oversaw Americas Camp 2019 in his native Colombia, Global Camp 2019 in Charlotte, Global
                Camp 2018 in Los Angeles, Global Camp 2017 in New Orleans, Americas Camp 2015 in Santo Domingo, Global Camp 2015
                in New York City, Americas Team Camp 2014 in Toronto, Americas Camp 2013 in Buenos Aires, Americas Camp 2011 in Rio
                de Janeiro and Americas Camp 2009 in Mexico City.</p>
              <p> Rosas’ past experiences include graduate assistant for the University of Houston men’s basketball team (2003-04), assistant
                coach on Westbury Christian High School’s state championship team (2002-03) and basketball coordinator for the Venezuelan
                Basketball Federation during the 2002 World Basketball Championships.</p>
              <p> A native of Bogotá, Colombia, Rosas graduated cum laude from the University of Houston with a BBA and was recently
                recognized as a Distinguished SEI Alumnus at the Bauer College of Business. He is married to Susana and they are proud
                parents of twins, Grayson and Giana.</p>

              <h2>Scott Layden<span>General Manager</span></h2>
              <p>Scott Layden is in his fourth season as General Manager with the Timberwolves, joining the franchise on April 26, 2016.</p>
              <p> Layden has more than 30 years of experience in the NBA, including spending four seasons prior to joining Minnesota as assistant general manager of the San Antonio Spurs under R.C. Buford and Gregg Popovich.
                During Layden’s time in San Antonio, the Spurs reached two NBA Finals, including winning the 2014 NBA Championship. Before joining the Spurs, Layden spent seven seasons with the Utah Jazz as an assistant coach under Jerry Sloan, his second stint with the Jazz.</p>
              <p> He began his professional career in 1980, serving as an assistant coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University before making the move to the NBA as an administrative assistant and scout with the Jazz in 1981. In 1982 he was elevated to assistant coach under his father, Frank Layden, a position he held until being named director of player personnel in 1989. He was promoted to director of basketball operations in 1992 and vice president in 1996.</p>
              <p> From 1992-99, Layden was primarily responsible for all player personnel, draft and trade decisions. The Jazz recorded five straight 50+ win seasons (including three 60+ win campaigns), two Midwest Division titles (1996-97 and 1997-98) and back-to-back Western Conference Championships in 1997 and 1998. He finished as runner up (to the Lakers’ Jerry West) for The Sporting News NBA Executive of the Year award in 1994-95, a season in which the Jazz went 60-22.</p>
              <p> In the summer of 1999, Layden was named general manager of the New York Knicks before being promoted to team president a year-and-a-half later. In his four-plus seasons in New York, the Knicks made the playoffs twice, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000.</p>
              <p> Before re-joining the Jazz in 2005, he worked with NBA TV for part of the 2003-04 and entirety of 2004-05 NBA seasons.
                An upstate New York prep standout, Layden went on to play collegiately for St. Francis University, where he was a four-year letterman and captained the team in his senior year of 1979-80. He graduated with a degree in business management.</p>
              <p> Layden has led camps in Israel in conjunction with PeacePlayers International, a program that uses basketball to teach children proven tactics for improving their communities. He has also worked basketball camps for both the NBA and Adidas in China, Brazil and Europe.</p>
              <p> Layden and his wife, Marsha, have four daughters: Hannah, Mary Frances Emma Grace and Sarah, who married her husband, Danny Witte in June 2018.</p>

In addition to his time with the Timberwolves and Lynx, Tanke also spent two seasons with the San Diego Chargers as their Director of Ticket and Suite Sales.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>As Chief Operating Officer, Tanke serves on the organization’s Executive Team charged with setting the strategic direction for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Minnesota Lynx, the Iowa Wolves, and T-Wolves Gaming, a member of the NBA’s 2K League.

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This past offseason, Tanke played a significant role in the transformation of the Timberwolves basketball operations by assisting in the search that led to the hiring of Gersson Rosas as the team’s President of Basketball Operations. Rosas is considered one of the most innovative minds in the game today and became the first Latino President/General Manager in the history of the NBA. In September, Tanke was a featured speaker at the Sports Business Journal/Sports Business Daily Ticketing Symposium in Los Angeles, focusing on the future of ticketing in sports.</p>

He continues to lead the organization’s fan experience efforts through initiatives such as Disney’s “1” Program and the team’s partnership with local chef David Fhima, making Target Center one of the most celebrated food and beverage experiences in professional sports.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Tanke’s strong work and reputation within the Twin Cities business community earned him recognition as a member of Minneapolis/St. Paul’s Business Journal’s Forty Under 40 class of 2011. He also was featured in Profile Magazine in April of 2019 discussing the renovation of Target Center and its transformational impact on partners and fans.</p>
